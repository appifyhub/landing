        <h2>The Terms</h2>
        <h3>1. Agreement to Terms</h3>
        <p>
            These Terms of Use constitute an agreement made between you, whether personally or on behalf of an entity
            (“<b>you</b>”) and Open Digital Services of Appify Hub, presented online and offline as AppifyHub
            ("<b>AppifyHub</b>", “<b>we</b>”, “<b>us</b>”, or “<b>our</b>”), concerning your access to and use of the
            website as well as any other media form, media channel, mobile website or mobile application related,
            linked, or otherwise connected thereto (collectively, the “Site”). We operate from Petrovaradin, Serbia. You
            agree that by accessing the Site, you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by all of these Terms of
            Use. We use Terms of Use and Terms of Service interchangeably.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not agree with all of these Terms of Use, then you are expressly prohibited from using the Site
            and you must discontinue use immediately.
        </p>
        <p>
            Supplemental terms and conditions or documents that may be posted on the Site from time to time are hereby
            expressly incorporated herein by reference. We reserve the right, in our sole discretion, to make changes or
            modifications to these Terms of Use from time to time. We will alert you about any changes by updating the
            “Last updated” date of these Terms of Use. We will do our best to notify all collaborators, participants and
            partners about any change to these Terms of Use, and you waive any right to receive specific notice of each
            such change. Please ensure that you check the applicable Terms every time you use our Site so that you
            understand which Terms apply. You will be subject to, and will be deemed to have been made aware of and to
            have accepted, the changes in any revised Terms of Use by your continued use of the Site after the date such
            revised Terms of Use are posted.
        </p>
        <p>
            The information provided on the Site is not intended for distribution to or use by any person or entity in
            any jurisdiction or country where such distribution or use would be contrary to law or regulation or which
            would subject us to any registration requirement within such jurisdiction or country. Accordingly, those
            persons who choose to access the Site from other locations do so on their own initiative and are solely
            responsible for compliance with local laws, if and to the extent local laws are applicable.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Site is not tailored to comply with industry-specific regulations (Health Insurance Portability and
            Accountability Act (HIPAA), Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA), etc), so if your
            interactions would be subjected to such laws, you may not use this Site. You may not use the Site in a way
            that would violate the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act (GLBA).
        </p>
        <p>
            The Site is intended for users who are at least 18 years old. Persons under the age of 18 are not permitted
            to use or register for the Site.

            similar intellectual property rights and unfair competition laws of the United States, international
            copyright laws, and international conventions. The Content and the Marks are provided on the Site “AS IS”
            for your information and personal use only. Considering that much of the Content is open-source, you are

            licensed, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose whatsoever, without our express prior written
            permission.

            any dispute which may arise in connection with these terms.
        </p>
        <h3>23. Dispute Resolution</h3>
        <h4>Informal Negotiations</h4>
        <p>
            To expedite resolution and control the cost of any dispute, controversy, or claim related to these Terms of
            Use (each "Dispute" and collectively, the “Disputes”) brought by either you or us (individually, a “Party”
            and collectively, the “Parties”), the Parties agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute (except those
            Disputes expressly provided below) informally for at least three hundred sixty five (365) days before
            initiating arbitration. Such informal negotiations commence upon written notice from one Party to the other
            Party.
        </p>
        <h4>Binding Arbitration</h4>
        <p>
            We require that any legal disputes arising from the use of our Site be resolved exclusively through
            arbitration, with arbitrators selected by us from our panel of recognized specialists. This process ensures
            that all parties have access to fair and expert resolution mechanisms. Additionally, all arbitration
            proceedings, as well as any legal claims related to our services, shall be governed by and construed in
            accordance with the local laws where our organization is headquartered (see the contact details below). This
            approach helps streamline the resolution process and provides clarity on the legal framework applicable to
            disputes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The number of arbitrators shall be two (2). The seat, or legal place, of arbitration shall be Belgrade,
            Serbia. The language to be used in the arbitral proceedings shall be Serbian. The governing law of the
            contract shall be the substantive law of Serbia.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            If you disagree with our requirement for resolving disputes exclusively through arbitration or any other
            terms outlined in our policies, we respectfully suggest discontinuing the use of our Site. Continuing to use
            our services constitutes your agreement to be bound by these terms, including the arbitration process and
            the application of our local laws to any disputes that may arise.
        </p>
        <h4>Restrictions</h4>
        <p>
            The Parties agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between the Parties individually. To
            the full extent permitted by law, (a) no arbitration shall be joined with any other proceeding; (b) there is
            no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class-action basis or to utilize class action
            procedures; and (c) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported
            representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons.
        </p>
        <h4>Exceptions to Informal Negotiations and Arbitration</h4>
        <p>
            The Parties agree that the following Disputes are not subject to the above provisions concerning informal
            negotiations and binding arbitration: (a) any Disputes seeking to enforce or protect, or concerning the
            validity of, any of the intellectual property rights of a Party; (b) any Dispute related to, or arising
            from, allegations of theft, piracy, invasion of privacy, or unauthorized use; and (c) any claim for
            injunctive relief. If this provision is found to be illegal or unenforceable, then neither Party will elect
            to arbitrate any Dispute falling within that portion of this provision found to be illegal or unenforceable
            and such Dispute shall be decided by a court of competent jurisdiction within the courts listed for
            jurisdiction above, and the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court.
