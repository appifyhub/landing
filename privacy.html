        <h2>Summary of key points</h2>
        <p class="text-muted">
            This summary provides key points from our privacy notice, but you can find out more details
            about any of these topics by using our table of contents and looking below to find the section you
            are looking for.
        </p>
        <h4>What personal information do we process?</h4>
        <p>
            When you visit, use, or navigate our Services, we may process personal information depending on how you
            interact with Appify Hub and the Services, the choices you make, and the products and features you use.
        </p>
        <h4>Do we process any sensitive personal information?</h4>
        <p>
            In our efforts to provide exceptional services through our app, there may be instances where the app, when
            integrated with Appify Hub, transmits sensitive personal information to us. We want to assure our users that
            the safeguarding of their data is our top priority. To this end, we employ industry-standard technologies
            and processes designed to protect your information.
        </p>
        <p>
            By default, we treat all user data as non-sensitive. We strongly advise our users to refrain from submitting
            sensitive personal information unless it is absolutely necessary for the use of the connected apps and
            services. In cases where sensitive data is transmitted to us, we commit to taking all reasonable measures to
            protect such information in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the ePrivacy
            Directive, the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), and other data protection laws mentioned below.
        </p>
        <p>
            We continuously assess and update our data protection practices to ensure they meet or exceed legal and
            regulatory requirements and align with best practices in data security and privacy. However, it's important
            for users to be aware that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is
            100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your personal information, we
            cannot guarantee its absolute security.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you receive any information from third parties?</h4>
        <p>
            Apps and services integrated with AppifyHub may transmit data to us, but we do not receive any information
            from third parties who are unaffiliated with AppifyHub. For more information on how the integrators are
            using your data, please refer to their privacy policies.
        </p>
        <h4>How do you process my information?</h4>
        <p>
            We process your information to provide, improve, and administer our Services, communicate with you, for
            security and fraud prevention, and to comply with law. We may also process your information for other
            purposes with your consent, for example to allow you to communicate with other users of the Services. We
            process your information only when we have a valid reason to do so.
        </p>
        <h4>In what situations and with which parties do we share personal information?</h4>
        <p>
            We may share information in specific situations and with a closed group of third parties. This is explained
            in more detail in the rest of this notice.
        </p>
        <h4>How do we keep your information safe?</h4>
        <p>
            Most of our source code is open-source for a reason. We have organizational procedures and technical
            processes in place to protect your personal information.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to
            be 100% secure — that is why we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information.
        </p>
        <h4>What are your rights?</h4>
        <p>
            Depending on where you are located geographically, the applicable privacy law may mean you have certain
            rights regarding your personal information. This is explained in more detail in the rest of this notice.
        </p>
        <h4>How do I exercise my rights?</h4>
        <p>
            The easiest way to exercise your rights is by contacting us at the email address given in the introduction.
            We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with applicable data protection laws.

            This information does not reveal your specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may
            include device and usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating
            system, language preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location, information about how and when
            you use our Services, and other technical information. This information is primarily needed to maintain the
            security and operation of our Services, and for our internal analytics and reporting purposes.
        </p>

            Like all other services, we also collect information through <b>cookies</b> and similar temporary

                    We may collect location data such as information about your device's location, which can be either

                    geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on your IP address). You can opt out of
                    allowing us to collect this information either by refusing access to the information, by disabling
                    your Location setting on your device, or using a VPN. However, if you choose to opt out, you may
                    not be able to use certain aspects of the Services.

            The General Data Protection Regulation (<b>GDPR</b>) and <b>UK GDPR</b> require us to

                    business interests and those interests do not outweigh your interests and fundamental rights and

        <h3>5. What is our Stance on Third-Party Websites?</h3>
        <h4>Unaffiliated Third-Party Services</h4>
        <p>
            Our Services may link to third-party websites, online services, or mobile applications and/or contain
            advertisements from third parties that are not affiliated with us and which may link to other websites,
            services, or applications. Accordingly, we do not make any guarantee regarding any such third parties, and
            we will not be liable for any loss or damage caused by the use of such third-party websites, services, or
            applications. The inclusion of a link towards a third-party website, service, or application does not imply
            an endorsement by us.
        </p>
        <p>
            We cannot guarantee the safety and privacy of data you provide to any third parties. Any data collected by
            third parties is not covered by this privacy notice. We are not responsible for the content or privacy and
            security practices and policies of any third parties, including other websites, services, or applications
            that may be linked to or from the Services. You should review the policies of such third parties and contact
            them directly to respond to your questions.
        </p>
        <h4>Unaffiliated Third-Party Integrators</h4>
        <p>
            When other apps and services integrate with our Services, they may transmit data to us. We receive, store,
            and process only the data necessary to provide the integration and to ensure the integration is working. We
            do not receive any information from third parties who are unaffiliated with Appify Hub. For more information
            on how the integrators (apps and websites) are using your data, please refer to their privacy policies.

        <p>
            We may share your information with our affiliated apps and websites, in which case we will require those
            affiliates to honor this privacy notice. Affiliates include our parent organization and/or any subsidiaries,
            joint venture partners, or other organizations that we control or that are under common control with us.

        <h3 id="cookies">6. Cookie Notice</h3>
        <p>
            We may use <b>cookies</b> and similar tracking technologies (like web beacons and pixels) to access or store
            information. Specific information about how we use such technologies and how you can refuse certain cookies
            is explained in the Cookie Notice below.
        </p>
        <p>
            This Cookie Policy section explains how we use cookies and similar technologies to recognize you when you
            visit our websites at Appify Hub and officially affiliated websites that also link to this policy,
            ("<b>Websites</b>"). It explains what these technologies are and why we use them, as well as your rights to
            control our use of them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In some cases we may use cookies to collect anonymous personal information, or information that becomes
            personal information if combined with other information.
        </p>
        <h4>What are cookies?</h4>
        <p>
            Cookies are small data files that are placed on your computer or mobile device when you visit a website.
            Cookies are widely used by website owners in order to make their websites work, or to work more efficiently,
            as well as to provide reporting information.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cookies set by the website owner (in this case, Open Digital Services of Appify Hub) are called "first party
            cookies". Cookies set by parties other than the website owner are called "third-party cookies". Third-party
            cookies enable third-party features or functionality to be provided on or through the website (e.g. like
            advertising, interactive content, or analytics). The parties that set these third-party cookies can
            recognize your computer both when it visits the website in question and also when it visits certain other
            websites.
        </p>
        <h4>Why do we use cookies?</h4>
        <p>
            We use first- and third-party cookies for several reasons. Some cookies are required for technical reasons
            in order for our Websites to operate, and we refer to these as "essential" or "strictly necessary" cookies.
            Other cookies also enable us to track and target the interests of our users to enhance the experience on our
            Online Properties. Third parties may serve cookies through our Websites for advertising, analytics and other
            similar purposes.
        </p>
        <h4>How can I control cookies?</h4>
        <p>
            You have the right to decide whether to accept or reject cookies. You can exercise your cookie rights by
            setting your preferences in the Cookie Consent Banner on the landing page of our Websites. Essential cookies
            cannot be rejected as they are strictly necessary to provide you with services.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to reject cookies, you may still use our website though your access to some functionality and
            areas of our website may be restricted. You may also set or amend your web browser controls to accept or
            refuse cookies. As the means by which you can refuse cookies through your web browser controls vary from
            browser to browser, you should visit
            <a href="https://www.cookieyes.com/blog/how-to-check-cookies-on-your-website-manually/">
                your browser's help menu
            </a>
            for more information. In addition, most advertising networks offer you a way to opt out of targeted
            advertising.
        </p>
        <p>
            The specific types of first and third-party cookies served through our Websites and the purposes they
            perform can be checked on the Cookie Consent Banner and using
            <a href="https://www.cookieyes.com/cookie-checker">this tool</a>.
        </p>
        <h4>What about other tracking technologies, like web beacons?</h4>
        <p>
            Cookies are not the only way to recognize or track visitors to a website. Very rarely we may use other,
            similar technologies from time to time, like web beacons (sometimes called "tracking pixels" or "clear
            gifs"). These are tiny graphics files that contain a unique identifier that enable us to recognize when
            someone has visited our Websites or opened an e-mail including them. This allows us, for example, to monitor
            the traffic patterns of users from one page within a website to another, to deliver or communicate with
            cookies, to understand whether you have come to the website from an online advertisement displayed on a
            third-party website, to improve site performance, and to measure the success of e-mail marketing campaigns.
            In many instances, these technologies are reliant on cookies to function properly, and so declining cookies
            will impair their functioning.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you use Flash cookies or Local Shared Objects?</h4>
        <p>
            Affiliated Websites may also use so-called "Flash Cookies" (also known as Local Shared Objects or "LSOs")
            to, among other things, collect and store information about your use of our services, fraud prevention and
            for other site operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you do not want Flash Cookies stored on your computer, you can adjust the settings of your Flash player
            to block Flash Cookies storage using the tools contained in the
            <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager07.html">
                Website Storage Settings Panel
            </a>.
            You can also control Flash Cookies by going to the
            <a href="http://www.macromedia.com/support/documentation/en/flashplayer/help/settings_manager03.html">
                Global Storage Settings Panel
            </a>
            and following the instructions (which may include instructions that explain, for example, how to delete
            existing Flash Cookies (referred to "information" on the Macromedia site), how to prevent Flash LSOs from
            being placed on your computer without your being asked, and (for Flash Player 8 and later) how to block
            Flash Cookies that are not being delivered by the operator of the page you are on at the time).
        </p>
        <p>
            Please note that setting the Flash Player to restrict or limit acceptance of Flash Cookies may reduce or
            impede the functionality of some Flash applications, including, potentially, Flash applications used in
            connection with our services or online content.
        </p>
        <h4>Do you serve targeted advertising?</h4>
        <p>
            Third-parties may serve cookies on your computer or mobile device to serve advertising through our Websites.
            These companies may use information about your visits to this and other websites in order to provide
            relevant advertisements about goods and services that you may be interested in. They may also employ
            technology that is used to measure the effectiveness of advertisements. This can be accomplished by them
            using cookies or web beacons to collect information about your visits to this and other sites in order to
            provide relevant advertisements about goods and services of potential interest to you. The information
            collected through this process does not enable us or them to identify your name, contact details or other
            details that directly identify you unless you choose to provide these.
        </p>
        <h4>How often will you update this Cookie Notice?</h4>
        <p>
            We may update this Cookie Notice from time to time in order to reflect, for example, changes to the cookies
            we use or for other operational, legal or regulatory reasons. Please therefore re-visit this Cookie Notice
            regularly to stay informed about our use of cookies and related technologies.

        <h3>7. How Long do we Keep your Information?</h3>
        <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is necessary for the purposes set out in this
            Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as tax, accounting,
            or other legal requirements). No purpose in this notice will require us keeping your personal information
            for longer than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal information, we will either delete
            or anonymize such information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal information
            has been stored in backup archives), then we will securely store your personal information and isolate it
            from any further processing until deletion is possible.
        </p>
        <p class="text-muted">
            Post-deletion of your account or after and opt-out request, we will ensure deletion of your personal
            information within 30 days.
        </p>
        <h3>8. How do we Keep your Information Safe?</h3>
        <p>
            We implement appropriate and reasonable technical and organizational security measures designed to protect
            the security of any personal information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure
            your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be
            guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other
            unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of
            personal information to and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access the Services
            within a secure environment.
        </p>
        <h4>Do we use SSL?</h4>
        <p>
            Yes, we use Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) technology to encrypt the connection between your device and our
            servers. This connection is secure and encrypted, and we use it to protect your personal information.
            However, we cannot guarantee that all data transmissions over the Internet are secure, and we cannot
            guarantee the security of your data while it is being transmitted to our Services via your router, modem,
            ISP, or other third party network providers.
        </p>
        <h3>9. Do we Collect Information from Minors?</h3>
        <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18 years of age. By using the Services,
            you represent that you are at least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and consent to
            such minor dependent's use of the Services. If we learn that personal information from users less than 18
            years of age has been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable measures to promptly
            delete such data from our records. If you become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
            age 18, please contact us immediately.

            when applicable law allows, will it affect the processing of your personal information conducted in reliance
            on lawful processing grounds other than consent.

        <h3>11. Controls for Do-Not-Track Features</h3>
        <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT")
            feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online
            browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing
            and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals
            or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard
            for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in
            a revised version of this Privacy Policy. In the meantime, we advise you to use an ad-blocker or a VPN.

            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about
            whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide
            information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance,
            depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can
            match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you
            through a communication method (e.g., phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also
            use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make
            the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the
            purposes of verification. However, if we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained
            by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity
            and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon
            as we finish verifying you.
